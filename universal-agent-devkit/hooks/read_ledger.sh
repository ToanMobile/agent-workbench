# read_ledger.sh — PostToolUse hook on Read. Records "this session looked at
# <file>" the instant it happens.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. precode_gate.sh answers "has this session looked at the file
# I am about to edit?" by scanning the session transcript. That answer is only
# as fresh as the transcript on disk, and the transcript is flushed in batches:
# tool calls made during the CURRENTLY RUNNING turn are still buffered and
# appear nowhere on disk. Measured 2026-08-04: the string
# "CrossScreenExtendedTest.kt" appeared 0 times across all 18 transcript files
# in this project directory while an Edit of that very file was being blocked,
# moments after it had been Read. The failure mode is systematic, not a race —
# every .kt/.java file first touched inside a long turn is unreachable, which is
# exactly the Read-then-Edit sequence W0 box 2 asks for. A gate that fires
# hardest on correct behaviour teaches people to reach for PRECODE_GATE=0.
#
# The fix is to stop depending on flush timing: this hook writes the fact down
# synchronously, and precode_gate consults the ledger alongside the transcript.
# It does NOT relax the gate — a file that was genuinely never read appears in
# neither source and is still blocked.
#
# ONLY Read is recorded. Recording Edit/Write here would re-introduce the
# self-disarming bug documented in precode_gate.sh: a blind edit ATTEMPT would
# mark the file as seen and clear the way for its own retry.
#
# Always exits 0. A PostToolUse hook runs after the edit has already happened,
# so it can only ever report — never block — and a bug in bookkeeping must not
# interrupt work.
# bash 3.2 compatible.
